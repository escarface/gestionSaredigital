// SERVER NOT REQUIRED
// We have switched to Firebase Realtime Database which supports direct connection from the frontend.
// You do not need to run "node server.js" anymore.
// The application now connects directly to: https://proyectos-94800-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com
console.log("This server file is deprecated. The app now connects directly to Firebase.");
